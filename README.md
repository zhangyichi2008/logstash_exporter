# logstash-exporter 

Exports [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/) metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for monitoring.

## Version compatibility and some important info

The exporter only supports Logstash >= v7.3. For earlier versions please check 
[sequra/logstash_exporter](https://github.com/sequra/logstash_exporter).

As some may notice, this is exporter is a result of multiple forks, we decided to create another version for a number 
of reasons:
- [sequra/logstash_exporter](https://github.com/sequra/logstash_exporter) maintainers doesn't seem to care about the 
  project anymore.
- This project builds binaries and docker images, eliminating the need for a project like
  [bitnami/bitnami-docker-logstash-exporter](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-logstash-exporter) which downloads
  a binary from [their servers](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-logstash-exporter/blob/master/7.3/debian-10/Dockerfile#L12), 
  which is **super creepy**.
- Bitnami's project doesn't offer a build for other architectures such as `arm64` and here at Leroy Merlin Brasil we 
  rely heavily on Logstash pods running on Graviton nodes.

## Run

For pre-built binaries, check the [releases page](https://github.com/leroy-merlin-br/logstash-exporter/releases).

### Docker

```sh
docker run leroymerlinbr/logstash_exporter:latest
```

                                The protocol, host and port on which logstash metrics API listens.
      --listen.address=":9198"  Address on which to expose metrics and web interface.
      --log.level="info"        The logging level to be defined.
      --version                 Show application version.
